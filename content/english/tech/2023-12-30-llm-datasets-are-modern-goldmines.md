Companies are now blocking web crawlers from accessing their copyright material so LLMs can’t be trained on this data. A concern people have is that LLMs will be trained on low quality data, making society more dumb and polarized.

While answering to this exact topic in [2023 Ask Us Anything • Your Undivided Attention • Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2nZlrgXCxM8kssONgZtsdh?si=sqOnXUJMR0ujOYiGk7Zc6w&t=470&context=spotify%3Ashow%3A4KI3PtZaWJbAWK89vgttoU), Tristan Harris said that “big AI labs are not disclosing all the datasets that they are training \[LLMs\] on”, so we can’t assess their quality. He continued by saying that “there are proposals in regulation and law that are saying that companies should have to disclose all the data that \[LLMs are\] trained on”.

To avoid copyright infringement, “providers of that data \[should be\] compensated and attributed”.
